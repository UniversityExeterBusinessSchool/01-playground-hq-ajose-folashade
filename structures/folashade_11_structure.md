# My Structure - Student XX

## What I See in My Data
[Describe the codes, letters, numbers]
## I see instructions on a fixed number of corners (4), height (2 units) and top size of 3X3. A type label: Elevated platform and a single colour, orange.
## What I Think This Means
[Interpret the patterns]
## I think it is giving instructions on construction rules for building LEGO structures. The corners and heights represent pillars while the top is the roof.
## Because there is no instruction on what would be in the middle, the middle will be empty.

## What This Could Be
[Your best guess - playground equipment?]
## Probably a small raised platform

## Questions I Have
[What don't you know yet?]
