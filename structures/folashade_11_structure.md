# My Structure - Student XX

## What I See in My Data
[Describe the codes, letters, numbers]
## I see an elevated platform with a hole in the middle.

## What I Think This Means
[Interpret the patterns]
## I think it is giving instructions on construction rules for building LEGO structures. The corners and heights represent pillars while the top is the roof.
## Because there is no instruction on what would be in the middle, the middle will be empty.

## What This Could Be
[Your best guess - playground equipment?]
## Probably a small raised platform

## Questions I Have
[What don't you know yet?]
## How does this relate to data?
